/*ways to write arrays
[]: bracket notation/ called literal syntax
new Array(): inside the () does not have to b strings, this is called an array function
[] is the common way to do it

find the amount of elements in the array use the [arrayName.length] method
.length is not zero base like an array.

to get the last element in the array use the [arrayName.length -1] method

Mutating the array:
arrayName [location of array] = 'new element'

An entire array can not be replaced

/*
Array Methods

ADD ELEMENTS:
.push() : add elements to the end of an array
(it is a function that is attached to an array)
    return the length of the new array

.unshift() : adds elements to the beginning of the array

REMOVE ELEMENTS:

.pop() : remove the last element of array
    nothing needs to be passed, does not return the length of the new array.

.shift()  : remove the first element of the array

.indexOf('element') : the position the element is in the array

es6 method:
return true/ false
    true if the element is in the array
    false if the element is not in the array

.includes('element') : will check is element is in the array es6 version
will test using the strict quality
